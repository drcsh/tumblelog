# tumblelog
Basic Tumblr clone using Flask, MongoDB and MongoEngine.

Started off following the [MongoEngine tutorial](http://docs.mongoengine.org/tutorial.html), but it has no front end, 
so I decided to plug Flask in as part of my efforts to learn it.

I also decided to use [Flask Blueprints](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/blueprints.html) to structure this project more like a 
large, production ready app would be structured.
