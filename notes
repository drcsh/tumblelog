- Need to write some basic password handling using hashlib. Annoyingly Mongoengine doesn't have a built in for this...
    - Maybe take a second look at hooking the password hashing into the pre_save signals on the User model, but it's not clear how to tell if the password changed.
- Add user registration
- Add post display
- Add Post creation - but only when logged in.
